# FooFightersFanpage
Foo Fighters Fan Website

This is a fan site for the band the Foo Fighters. This is the first application I made before my coding boot camp started. We were asked to do some prework before the class started. I had no prior knowledge of web applications. It is a basic website but I'm proud of what I did before I became a full stack web developer.
